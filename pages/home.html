    Welcome to BillSplit!<br />
    
    <p>BillSplit is a feature that incorporates the Ripple Network and allows a group of friends to split a payment to a merchant without credit card hassles. Currently, when large groups of people eat at a restaurant, the restaurant must foot the credit card fees, and they simply refuse to deal with charging more than one or two cards. BillSplit allows an alternate method of payment that enables the customers to choose the amounts they want to pay, and once the minimum amount required by the restaurant is reached, the restaurant is paid. There are virtually no hidden fees and the process is irreversible.</p>
